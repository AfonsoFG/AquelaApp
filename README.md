## ThatApp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AfonsoFG/ThatApp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AfonsoFG/ThatApp)

This app was created for an intesive React Development course.

### The idea

Have in the same app all the different small apps done during the course.

### List of features

* ToDo list
* Blog
* Metronome
* Calculator
* Weather 
* About page
* Many SVG experiments. Inlined, included as ReactComponent and as CSS background


### Notes
Don't take the commit list (and messages) very seriously ... I was also learning the Github ropes as I went along :)
